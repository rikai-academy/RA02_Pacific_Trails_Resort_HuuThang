<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that be opened.</dd>


<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>


<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
    dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
    It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
    adventure!</dd>
